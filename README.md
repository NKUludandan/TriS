TriS: A Comprehensive Model for Writing Style Change Detection by Integrating Semantic, Syntactic, and Stylistic Features

The exploration of writing style shifts within multi-authored texts is a promising field in
computational linguistics. It aims to localize instances of style transition, exhibiting immense
potential for real-world applications such as plagiarism detection, forensic analysis, literary
study, and author attribution. In this paper, we propose the model TriS for multi-author
writing style change detection. TriS comprises three modules, namely Semantic, Syntactic,
and Stylistic encoders, leveraging fine-tuned BERT models and a Logistic Regression classifier
to analyze stylometric patterns associated with style shifts. This study focuses on the task
presented in PAN Multi-Author Writing Style Analysis 2023, which is characterized by constrained topic information.
