TriS: A Comprehensive Model for Writing Style Change Detection by Integrating Semantic, Syntactic, and Stylistic Features

The exploration of writing style shifts within multi-authored texts is a promising field in computational linguistics. It aims to localize instances of style transition, exhibiting immense potential for real-world applications such as plagiarism detection, forensic analysis, literary study, and author attribution. In this project, we propose the model TriS for multi-author writing style change detection. TriS comprises three modules, namely Semantic, Syntactic, and Stylistic encoders, leveraging fine-tuned BERT models and a Logistic Regression classifier to analyze stylometric patterns associated with style shifts. This study focuses on the task presented in [PAN Multi-Author Writing Style Analysis 2023](https://pan.webis.de/clef23/pan23-web/style-change-detection.html), which is characterized by constrained topic information.
