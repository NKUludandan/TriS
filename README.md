TriS: A Comprehensive Model for Writing Style Change Detection by Integrating Semantic, Syntactic, and Stylistic Features

The exploration of writing style shifts within multi-authored texts is a promising field in computational linguistics. It aims to localize instances of style transition, exhibiting immense potential for real-world applications such as plagiarism detection, forensic analysis, literary study, and author attribution. In this project, we propose the model TriS for multi-author writing style change detection. TriS comprises three modules, namely **S**emantic, **S**yntactic, and **S**tylistic encoders, leveraging fine-tuned BERT models and a Logistic Regression classifier to analyze stylometric patterns associated with style shifts. This study focuses on the task presented in [PAN Multi-Author Writing Style Analysis 2023](https://pan.webis.de/clef23/pan23-web/style-change-detection.html), which is characterized by constrained topic information.

## Full Model
The main body of our model consists of three modules (Figure ![本地图片](images/full model.jpg "本地示例图片")). The first part is a text content analysis module that utilizes BERT as a pre-trained model (**Semantic Encoder**). This module examines the textual content and extracts semantic information for style analysis. The second part is a POS-tag encoder module that also utilizes BERT as a pre-trained model (**Syntactic Encoder**). It encodes the part-of-speech tags of the text, which can provide additional syntactic insights into the writing style. Lastly, the third part is a logistic regression model (**Stylistic Encoder**) that analyzes the stylistic features of the text. This module captures specific linguistic patterns and features that contribute to writing style. The outputs of these three sub-models are then fused together in our fusion module (**Fusion Recognizer**), which combines and integrates the individual outputs to provide the final analysis result.
